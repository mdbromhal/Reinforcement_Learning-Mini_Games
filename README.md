# Reinforcement_Learning-Mini_Games
ABSTRACT: Playing Cartpole &amp; Breakout with OpenAI Gym

- Reinforcement learning = type of machine learning
- The agent learns by interacting with its environment
  - It receives rewards when it does the action we want it to do
  - Receives penalties when it doesn't => it learns by experimenting
 

## Cartpole
- This is a reinforcement learning game we can run with OpenAI gym to briefly show how reinfocement learning works
- Here, the agent is trying to keep the stick from falling too far on one side or another, so it moves the cart accordingly
